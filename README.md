# Twitter-Data-Scrapping-and-Sentimental-Analysis-of-a-Trending-Topic

This is a Twitter data mining project to quickly get an overall idea of the tweets about a trending topic. A sentimental analysis of the tweets is done and the findings are represented in the form of word clouds and dendrograms for easy understanding.

* [Connection to Twitter, creating Word Clouds & Dendrograms - Code](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Twitter-Data-Scrapping-and-Sentimental-Analysis-of-a-Trending-Topic/blob/master/TwitterDataScrappping.R) : Use this code as a guide to connect R with twitter and scrape data.

* [Sample Outputs](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Twitter-Data-Scrapping-and-Sentimental-Analysis-of-a-Trending-Topic/tree/master/SampleOutputs) : The sample outputs for the Sentiment analysis of Twitter data can be found here.

So the next time you want to get a big picture about any topic in Twitter, use this code!

**Note :** 
* Twitter allows only 15 scrapes in 15 minutes
* The Twitter Search API searches against a sampling of recent Tweets published in the past 7 days. So only tweets in the last 7 days can be mined
